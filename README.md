# Plant Disease Diagnosis Datasets

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of datasets consolidated from Kaggle's public dataset repository. These datasets are utilized in our studies on plant disease diagnosis using deep learning models. Each dataset focuses on a different plant species, providing a diverse range of data crucial for the development and testing of our models.

## Datasets Included
The datasets included in this repository are as follows:

- **Rice Leaf Disease Dataset**: Consists of images categorized into four types of rice diseases. [View Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maimunulkjisan/rice-leaf-dataset-from-mendeley-data)
- **Grapevine Leaf Image Dataset**: Contains images of different grapevine varieties, each representing specific leaf conditions. [View Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/grapevine-leaves-image-dataset)
- **Bean Leaf Lesion Dataset**: Features images of bean leaves showing three different types of leaf lesions. [View Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/bean-leaf-lesions-classification?select=train)
- **Cassava Leaf Dataset**: Comprises images labeled into five classes, distinguishing between various disease states and healthy leaves. [View Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/data)

## Purpose
The purpose of gathering these datasets into a single repository is to provide easier access and a unified reference for researchers and developers working on agricultural applications of machine learning, specifically in the area of disease diagnosis in plants.

## Acknowledgments
All datasets are hosted and maintained as part of Kaggle's public dataset repository. We acknowledge the dataset creators and Kaggle for making these resources available to the public, facilitating this and other research projects.

## How to Use
To use these datasets, you can clone this repository or directly download the desired dataset files. Each dataset directory contains a `README` file with detailed information about the dataset, including source acknowledgments, data format, and usage guidelines.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the datasets or the repository are welcome. Please submit an issue or pull request if you have suggestions or additions.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and we hope it serves as a valuable resource for your projects.
